# Pursuit Jobs Board

Currently jobs postings at Pursuit are shared via Slack by the community or maintained by staff using an Airtable-based application without a structured workflow for submissions from the Pursuit community. The Pursuit Jobs Board aspires to create a unified institutional networking application for Pursuit Fellows, Alumni and Staff to share job postings discovered from job aggregator sites and company/organizational sites. Users create accounts to verify their Pursuit institutional relationship. The main page displays a running feed of the most recently submitted job postings. Users will be able to search jobs postings based on keywords and job locations as well as filter search results based on job type, closing date and remote status. Job Postings can be saved by users, which will then be accesses and listed via their profile page. Users will be able to specify if they've applied to a saved job and view a list of their applied jobs.
